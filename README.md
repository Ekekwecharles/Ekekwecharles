Hi, I'm **Ekekwe Chinonso Charles**, a passionate Frontend Developer from Anambra State, Nigeria, currently based in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. I specialize in building dynamic, user-friendly web applications with a focus on performance and maintainability.

With expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a strong foundation in modern frameworks and tools like React, Redux Toolkit, React Query, TypeScript and Nextjs, I create scalable solutions tailored to users' needs. I’m also skilled in styling libraries like Styled Components, Tailwind CSS, and Sass/SCSS, enabling me to craft visually appealing and responsive designs.

Key Technologies I Work With:
- Frontend Development: React, Nextj, React Router, Context API, React Hook Form

I am deeply passionate about crafting intuitive user interfaces and seamless user experiences. I thrive on solving challenges and continually growing by learning new technologies and best practices.

Currently, I aim to expand my skill set to become a Full Stack Developer, integrating backend technologies to deliver end-to-end solutions. I am driven by a commitment to continuous improvement and contributing to impactful projects that push boundaries in the tech space.

When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring new tools and collaborating with other developers to create meaningful solutions.
